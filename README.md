Calculator Exercise details:

Create a web app using any language which logs calculations as they happen and shares those calculations with everyone connected to the app.

 

For example, user A and user B go to your app at the same time. User A calculates “5 + 5”, which equals “10". This is logged below the calculator as “5 + 5 = 10”. User B is updated about this calculation right after user A posts it. Now, user B calculates “3 x 4".This calculates to “12” and displays “3 x 4=12" right below the prior calculation. User A sees this update immediately after user B posts it.

 

Results should remain between sessions. Only show the last 10 calculations descending from most recent to oldest. The calculator only needs to implement basic arithmetic operations, although you can add other math functions if you would like to impress. But don't forget to meet the basic requirements of the exercise first!
